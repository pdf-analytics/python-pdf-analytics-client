Installation
============

To install PyPDFAnalyticsClient, install the `pdf_analytics_client` package from PyPI and dependencies.

On Windows, this is:

    ``C:\Python34\pip.exe install pdf_analytics_client``

(Though you may have a different version of Python installed other than 3.4)

On OS X, this is:

    ``pip3 install pdf_analytics_client``


On Linux, this is:

    ``pip3 install pdf_analytics_client``


PyPDFAnalyticsClient will try to install python requests. This happens when pip installs PyPDFAnalyticsClient.
